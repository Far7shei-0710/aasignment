        I'm learning HTML! This page is about the beauty of nature.Nature is a beautiful and powerful force.
         It surrounds us every day, from the trees in the forest to the waves in the ocean.
         Nature gives us everything we need to survive, like clean air, fresh water, and food.
          It is full of wonder, with animals living in harmony in their natural habitats. Natureâ€™s 
          beauty can be seen in the colors of the sky at sunrise, the patterns of leaves on trees, and
           the sounds of birds singing. However, nature is also fragile. Human activities, such as pollution
            and deforestation, have had a negative impact on the environment. It is important for us to protect
             and preserve nature, ensuring that future generations can enjoy the same beauty and resources that we
              do.
